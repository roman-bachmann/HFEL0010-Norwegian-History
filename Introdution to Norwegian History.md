### Early Days

Why did people migrate to the north, 10'000 years ago?  
-> They moved because of *resources* like fish, reindeer, etc...

Slowly, coming from the south, *agriculture took the upper hand* in the country over gathering. Gathering remained important for quite a long time.

### Agricultural Revolution in the north

**Advantages** of agriculture:

* Reliability
* Can stock up food
* Feeds more people

**Disadvantages** of agriculture:

* Difficult to grow
* Requires a lot of work (Hunter gatherer societies use less work on average, since they have periods of hunting / gathering and periods of rest)

Stocking up food leads to *social political structures*, where some people have power over other people, since they are controlling the stocks, supply, etc… Agriculture also introduced the need for metal tools, which lead to increased productivity and *better weapons -> concentration of power in a small group*. Establishment of military power.

### Structure in early Norway

Large number of small political units along Norway. 

After 600, Norway enters european consciousness.

Ottar shows an *integrated trade economy all along Norway, Denmark and England*, as well as a *one big cultural and linguistic region*. No mention about any large political structures in this region.

### Viking expansion

The Viking Age begins with a raid on monastery in northern England. Raiders singled out rich institutions as their targets. Raids later expanded to more regions, like the east and to large rivers in Europe.

Trade & the viking expansion of settlements are two important aspects that happened at the same time. Settlements in north atlantic islands -> Iceland, Shetland, Faroese, Greenland, because of a *population surplus, better ships and the concentration of power*. The new settlements depended on trade with Norway. Iceland grew to ca. 20000 inhabitants.

Local trade was very important: furs, amber, tusks and also luxury products. Scandinavians became *more integrated* into the european trade network.

Viking expansion:

* Why: Population surplus, better ships, concentration of power
* How: Trade, Settlements, Plunder
* Consequences: Further Concentration of wealth and power, Spread of norse culture and trading networks in the north atlantic, Import of religious and political ideas

### Chieftains

A chieftain lived in a big house on his farm. His slaves / workers lived on the same land, but in a smaller house. Around the land of the chieftain was the land of other farmers, where they had their houses, but it was also controlled by the chieftain. There was other spheres of influences of chieftains. Some people were in the middle of two spheres and they seek out one of them, that gave them the most profit and protection. Almost all people were "forced" to join one chieftain and give him his loyalty and support by joining his raids.

The chieftains’ power:

* Economic power: Wealth, ownership of land
* Personal power: Slaves and dependants
* Legal power: Loyal followers at legal assemblies
* Maintaining and increasing power: War, strategic alliances (marriage, friendship)

### Ting

A Ting was a legal assembly, where all free men would meet and settle disputes, that were destabilising society (Settlements in court). Whoever could gather the most support would win the dispute. People would go to the legal assembly with their chieftain and support him. Therefor it was important to have a lot of people loyal to the chieftain. More influential people could influence the outcome more, since there was no strict laws. 

### Introducing laws

More wealth from trades and raids leads to fewer but more powerful chieftains -> decentralised aristocratic society.

Through raiding and trading and thus the contact with more advanced states, Norwegians were inspired to adapt some of those political units. Slowly, larger regions introduced unwritten laws / rules. As this became more complicated, some people (*lagmenn* - early form of judges) would memorise the rules and give advice. In the 11th century, those laws were written down.

* *-rike* suffix -> empire
* *-land* suffix -> community with similar culture
* *-lag* suffix -> lag = law, meaning that there is some sort of law on a regional scale. Eg: *Trøndelag*

### The Håløyg and Ynglinge dynasties

Håløyg family had their base in northern Norway and expanded southwards. Ynglinge family was in the south and expanded northwards. In the end, Ynglinge gained the upper hand. Harald Hårfagre became the first king and Norway became a kingdom. They controlled the area from Stavanger to Ålesund.


Establishment of the kingdom:

* Larger political units
* Regional legal territories (Gulating, Frostating)
* Concentration of power to very few families
* The earls of Håløyg/Lade-dynasty and the kings of the Ynglinge-dynasty share power from the late 9th century

### Snorre Sturlason

Most information about this time comes from *Snorre Sturlason*. The core of the sagas were true, but exaggerated. The sagas are representing the political climate of the 13th century with stories about the 9-10th centuries.
